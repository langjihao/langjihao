I'm  Jihao Lang (郎吉豪). I'm currently pursuing a graduate degree in AI in Tianjin, focusing on medical multimodality. I have a strong passion for automating anything and everything, believing that any repetitive task can be optimized through code. My journey is all about going "from AI boy to API boy," inspired by a Da Vinci syndrome mindset—always curious, always learning, and always building across multiple domains.
